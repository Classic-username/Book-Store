        // The relationships between the classes are as follows:
        // The Book class represents the basic attributes and behavior of a book.
        // The User class represents the registered users of the bookstore.
        // The ShoppingCart class manages the items added to the shopping cart.
        // The Order class represents an order placed by a user and contains information about the user, items, date, and status of the order.
        // The Bookstore class acts as the central entity that manages the catalog of books, registered users, shopping cart, and orders.
        // Note: This is a simplified representation of the classes and their relationships. Depending on the complexity and requirements of your project, you may need to add more classes and refine the relationships and methods.
